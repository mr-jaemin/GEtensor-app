# ðŸŽˆ GE Diffusion tensor App (beta)
## View/Convert GE tensor to bval/bvec
by Jaemin Shin

The **GEtensor-app** is a web-based tool created with Python and Streamlit to facilitate the viewing and conversion of GE diffusion tensor files in a user-friendly format. The app provides an intuitive summary of b-values, such as:
- b= 0 x 8
- b= 500 x 6
- b= 1000 x 15
- b= 2000 x 15
- b= 3000 x 60

It also presents b-vectors in a structured table format, and allows users to convert the data to FSL's bval/bvec format for download.

GE's diffusion gradient directions, including FSL bvec format, are rotation invariant. This means that no matter the scanning orientationâ€”whether it's double-oblique, straight axial, head-first, or feet-firstâ€”the b-vectors stay the same, as long as the frequency encoding direction doesnâ€™t change.

You may find this app particularly useful if you need:
- An intuitive display of b-values from a tensor file.
- Conversion of GE tensor data to FSL bval/bvec format.
- A case when only tensor file id available, without access to valid DICOM files.
